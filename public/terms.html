  <h1>Terms of Services</h1>
  <h2>Use of Our Service</h2>
  <p>Matchmaking is the core of what we do for real estate. When the time is right, we make a professional introduction between you and one of our Real Estate Agent partners. The service that we provide to sellers of real estate and real estate
    professionals is governed by a few terms that are outlined below.
  </p>
  <p>Because we are an online service, we don’t ask you to deal with and physically sign a lengthy contract. The terms of our contract with you are set forth below in plain language. If you don’t agree with the terms, then we ask you please to leave
    this Web site. If you do use this Web site, then that action will serve as your agreement to be bound by our terms of service.
  </p>
  <p>All American Software Solutions is operated in compliance with all state and federal housing laws.
  </p>
  <h2>Terms for Broker and Agents
  </h2>
  <p>Real estate professionals who are involved with and use our Web site must agree with the following terms:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>You grant permission to All American Software Solutions to display on our Web site and elsewhere information that we have gathered or you have supplied related to any of the real estate transactions that you have handled as a real estate
      professional. This information helps your potential clients better understand your specialties.
    </li>
    <li>You are responsible for maintaining your own real estate license and for following all applicable real estate laws regarding disclosures, documentation and other brokerage responsibilities. In addition, you are responsible for the real
      estate brokerage services provided to your clients and agree to indemnify, defend and hold All American Software Solutions harmless from any claims, costs, and damages incurred by All American Software Solutions arising from claims by your
      clients regarding the brokerage services you have provided.</li>
    <li>Your participation in our service is voluntary and can be terminated by either of us for any reason at any time with written notice. However, any referrals made prior to such termination are still bound by this agreement, and Referral Fees
      will be due upon close of any transactions resulting from such referrals.
    </li>
    <li>In connection with the referrals, you agree to be contacted by All American Software Solutions and its referrals via phone, email, mail or other reasonable means, and you further agree that you will not provide the referrals to any other
      party without our written consent.
    </li>
    <li>You may initiate or receive a call from a All American Software Solutions representative or one of our referrals via one of All American Software Solutions’ tracked phone numbers. If you do so, All American Software Solutions may create a
      digital audio recording of the call. You acknowledge and agree that your phone call may be recorded for quality assurance purposes only.
    </li>
    <li>Any information that you provide to All American Software Solutions shall be accurate, complete and owned by you, and you agree to update any information that is or becomes inaccurate. Of course, if we discover that any information is
      inaccurate we may correct it ourselves. You hereby grant us permission to e-mail or display your Profile (including your name, likeness, contact information and transaction details) and such other information as may be supplied by you on or
      from our Web site "www.co-realestatsales.com" and such other partner and affiliate websites as we believe advisable for marketing purposes.

  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>When the time is right, we may make a professional introduction between you and one of our partners, including our real estate agent partners. Of course, this introduction involves sharing the contact information of each party with the
      other. When you submit information to www.co-realestatsales.com for a request, you authorize us to use and provide this information to make an introduction. By providing this information to us, you consent to being contacted by us and by our partners via
      phone, email, mail or other reasonable means.</li>

    <li>You understand that while All American Software Solutions may refer real estate professionals, we do not perform real estate brokerage services. Any Real Estate brokerage activities are performed by local Real Estate Professionals that have

    <li>You understand that for our services we may receive payment (a referral fee) that may be a percentage of the commission received by the professionals involved in the real estate transaction. There is no charge to you. Any payment is due

      professionals disclaim any warranty of any kind, whether express or implied, as to any matter whatsoever relating to the web site and any information, software, products and services provided herein, including without limitation the implied
      warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and noninfringement. Use of All American Software Solutions’ service is at your own risk. We and/or its suppliers, are not liable for any direct, indirect, punitive,
      incidental, special or consequential damages or other injury arising out of or in any way connected with the use of our services or with the delay or inability to use the web site, or for any information, software, products and services
      obtained through the web site, or otherwise arising out of the use of the web site, whether resulting in whole or in part, from breach of contract, tortious behavior, negligence, strict liability or otherwise, even if we and/or its suppliers
      had been advised of the possibility of damages. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so the above exclusion may not apply to you.</li>
    <li>You also agree to the following: In no event shall All American Software Solutions or our suppliers be liable for lost profits or any special, incidental or consequential damages (however arising, including negligence) arising out of or in
      connection with this agreement. Our liability, and the liability of our suppliers, to you or any third parties in any circumstance, is limited to $100. Some states do not allow the limitation of liability, so the foregoing limitation may not
      always apply.
    </li>
    <li>You also agree to the following dispute resolution, arbitration, and class action waiver: Instead of suing in Court, you and All American Software Solutions agree to arbitrate all disputes between you and All American Software Solutions or
      any of All American Software Solutions’ agents, representatives, or partners acting on All American Software Solutions’ behalf, on an individual basis, not on a class-wide or consolidated basis. The FAA applies to this agreement, the
      arbitration provision, and all questions of whether a dispute is subject to arbitration. Unless we each agree otherwise, the Arbitration will be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator and will take place in the county of your residence. We
      each agree that we will only pursue arbitration on an individual basis and will not pursue arbitration on a class-wide or consolidated basis. We each agree that any arbitration will be solely between you and All American Software Solutions (or
      All American Software Solutions’ agents, representatives, or partners acting on All American Software Solutions’ behalf). We each waive any rights to bring a class action or consolidated action. Exceptions: Either of us may bring qualifying
      claims in small claims court.
    </li>
    <li>Finally, you also agree to the following: These Terms of Service shall be subject to and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Colorado, without regard to its conflict of laws principles. If any part of these Terms of Service
      are determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded
      by a valid enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision, and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in effect. A printed version of this Agreement and of any notice given in electronic form shall
      be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.
      All rights not expressly granted herein are reserved to All American Software Solutions.
    </li>
